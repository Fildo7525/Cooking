### Instructions

#### Salad
Peel the orange and cut it into small pieces. Cut the pineapple into small pieces. Take a half of onion and split it into 2
parts. Chop the first 1/4 of onion into small pieces and add it into the salad. Mix the fruit together in a bowl. Boil 1 egg
for 10 minutes, then peel it and cut it into small pieces. Add the egg to the salad.

#### Meat

Remove the skin from the chicken feat and remove the bones and cartilage. Split the meat into small pieces. Chop the
remaining 1/4 of onion into small pieces and add it to the meat. Add oyster sauce and spices. Mix it all together in a
bowl and leave it for 1 hour in the fridge.

Preheat the pan with some oil for the meat to not stick. Add the meat with the mixture to the pan and leave it there until
the meat is cooked. It should take about 10-15 minutes. Stir it occasionally to not burn it.

#### Serving

Put the salad on a plate and add the meat on top of it. Serve it with some bread.
